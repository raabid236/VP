Run 'Script.m' to run all the parts using single click.
By default it will run all steps.

% f_zoom = function for creating zoom sequence 2
% f_rotation = function for creating rotation sequence 3
% f_projective = function for creating projective sequence 1
% functions folder contains functions for matching and folder also contains
% vlfeat and sift libraries
1) For step1, comment and uncomment each sequence as required
   in the 'Script.m'
2) For step2, comment or uncomment the plots as required
   in sript.m file in the second section
3) For step3, comment or uncomment the plots as required

   You can run plots in step 3 directly if you have run previous steps
   by running step3plots.
